This is a Work In Progress English patch for the Switch version of Ar nosurge: Ode to an Unborn Star Deluxe.  
  
The patch currently includes the following:  
  
- 60FPS Framerate unlock (originally 30)
- Fully ported English Dub
- All Story dialogue in English
- All Tutorial texts in English and properly adapted to the Switch control scheme (original english versions only exist on PS control schemes)
  
  
What is currently missing?  
  
- Majority of UI text, this is due to the fact that UI text is found on the game's executable which means it needs code patching
- All UI images, this patch is based on the English Vita version which means the resolution of UI images is not compatible
  
  
Installation:  
In your SD card, check that the following folders exist, if they dont exist, manually create them:  
atmosphere -> contents -> 01003cf0128de000  
  
Extract the contents of this mod using something like 7zip, and you should get a "romfs" and a "exefs" folder, place both of these folders in the "01003cf0128de000" folder you created (if it did not exist before).

ENGLISH DUB:  
- If you do not want the included English dub, delete the "Data" folder that is included inside the romfs folder from the extracted mod files.
